# Subspace

```@example
using QuantumOptics # hide
b = FockBasis(5)
b_sub = SubspaceBasis(b, [fockstate(b, 1), fockstate(b, 2)])

P = projector(b_sub, b)

x = coherentstate(b, 0.5)
x_prime = P*x
y = dagger(P)*x_prime # Not equal to x
nothing # hide
```

Oftentimes it is possible to restrict a large Hilbert to a small subspace while still retaining the most important physical effects. This reduction can be done with the [`SubspaceBasis`](@ref) which is implemented as:

```julia
type SubspaceBasis <: Basis
    shape::Vector{Int}
    superbasis::Basis
    basisstates::Vector{Ket}
end
```

## Operators

To project states into the subspace or re-embed them into the super-space a projection operator can be used:

* [`projector`](@ref)


## Additional functions

If the states used to define the subspace are not orthonormal one can use the orthonormalize function to obtain an ONB:

* [`subspace.orthonormalize`](@ref)


## Examples

* [Example N particles in a double well`
